        <h2>Definition of Sunshine</h2>
        <p><span>Sunshine is the light and warmth that comes from the sun, bringing life and energy to our planet. Just like the sun, some people radiate warmth, positivity, and happiness, lighting up the lives of those around them. For me (and hopefully a lot more people) YOU are that person, Eshita. You are a gift to the world that everyone should learn to cherish.</span></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section2">
        <h2>The contract:</h2>
        <p><span>When you became my friend you essentially entered into a contract. All of your (and my) sorrows and hardships are for me to carry and all my happiness (and yours) are for you to cherish.... So if you ever need someone to talk to (or cry to) just remember that I'm always here... whenever you want! So dont be selfish... Share your problems and your weaknesses with me and I will be there as your strength. Always and Forever, because we're BFFs for life, Right??</span></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section3">
            <h2> You survived life for exactly </h2>
            <div class="clock-holder">
                <font id="days"></font> Days:
                <font id="hours"></font> Hours:
                <font id="minutes"></font> Minutes:
                <font id="seconds"></font> Seconds
            </div>
            <p>
                And yet you still stand strong and resilient. You will get through everything life throws at you. Because you are sunshine and nothing can stop you from illuminating our lives just like nothing can stop the sun from lighting up this world.
